# Plugin Integration Guide Pack (v2)

This pack is written for your Codex workflow: minimal links, maximum "do exactly this" guidance.

Includes:
- Detailed implementation guides (how to implement + what to return + how to verify)
- Field mappings to your host plugin model (OrderNo/TradeNo/Amount/Status/AckBody)
- Concrete checklists to prevent the current "behavior mismatch" bugs
- Optional scripts to fetch official open-source SDK repos

Most important file:
- docs/00-START-HERE.md
